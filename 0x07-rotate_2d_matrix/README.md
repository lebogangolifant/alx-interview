# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`) that implements a function to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. Additionally, a test script (`main_0.py`) is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented function.

## Files

- **0-rotate_2d_matrix.py**: Contains the `rotate_2d_matrix` function that rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
- **main_0.py**: A test script that imports and tests the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.

## Concepts Covered

- **Matrix Rotation**: The script demonstrates the rotation of a 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, utilizing concepts such as matrix transposition and reversing rows.
  
- **Python Programming**: The implementation showcases basic Python programming concepts, including loops, list manipulation, and in-place operations.

## Usage

To test the `rotate_2d_matrix` function: 
- make the script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x main_0.py
```
- run the provided test script:

```bash
./main_0.py
```

This will display the 2D matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise as specified.
