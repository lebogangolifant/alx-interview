# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`0-lockboxes.py`) that implements a function to determine whether all the boxes in a set of lockboxes can be opened. Additionally, a test script (`main_0.py`) is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented function.

## Files

- **0-lockboxes.py**: Contains the `canUnlockAll` function that checks if all lockboxes can be opened.
- **main_0.py**: A test script that imports and tests the `canUnlockAll` function.

## Concepts Covered

- **Lockboxes Algorithm**: The script implements an algorithm to determine if all lockboxes can be opened, based on the presence of keys in each box.

- **Python Programming**: The implementation follows Python programming standards, including function definitions, loops, Conditional Statements, Algorithmic Logic, Lists and Set Manipulation.

## Usage

To test the `canUnlockAll` function:

- Make the script executable:
  ```bash
  chmod u+x main_0.py
  ```
- Run the provided test script:

  ```bash
  ./main_0.py
  ```

This will display whether all lockboxes in various scenarios can be opened or not.
