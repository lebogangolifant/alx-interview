# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`0-minoperations.py`) that implements a function to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file using the "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. Additionally, a test script (`0-main.py`) is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented function.

## Files

- **0-minoperations.py**: Contains the `minOperations` function that calculates the minimum operations required.
- **0-main.py**: A test script that imports and tests the `minOperations` function.

## Concepts Covered

- **Prime Factorization**: The script utilizes the concept of prime factorization to calculate the minimum operations needed to reach the target number of 'H' characters.

- **Python Programming**: The implementation showcases basic Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and integer operations.

## Usage

To test the `minOperations` function:
- make the script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x 0-main.py
```
- run the provided test script:

```bash
./0-main.py
```

This will display the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters.
