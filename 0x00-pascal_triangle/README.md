# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`0-pascal_triangle.py`) that implements a function to generate Pascal's Triangle with 'n' rows. Additionally, a test script (`0-main.py`) is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented function.

## Files

- **0-pascal_triangle.py**: Contains the `pascal_triangle` function that generates Pascal's Triangle.
- **0-main.py**: A test script that imports and tests the `pascal_triangle` function.

## Concepts Covered

- **Pascal's Triangle**: The script demonstrates the generation of Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

- **Python Programming**: The implementation showcases basic Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and lists.


## Usage

To test the `pascal_triangle` function: 
- make the script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x 0-main.py
```
- run the provided test script:

```bash
./0-main.py
```

This will display Pascal's Triangle with a specified number of rows.
