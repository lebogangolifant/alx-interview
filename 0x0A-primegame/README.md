# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`0-prime_game.py`) that implements a function to determine the winner of a competitive game scenario called the Prime Game. Additionally, a test script (`main_0.py`) is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented function.

## Files

- **0-prime_game.py**: Contains the `isWinner` function that determines the winner of the Prime Game based on the given rounds and sets of consecutive integers.
- **main_0.py**: A test script that imports and tests the `isWinner` function.

## Concepts Covered

- **Prime Numbers**: The script utilizes prime numbers and efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers within a given range.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: The implementation includes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers.
- **Game Theory**: The script implements game logic and strategies for determining the winner of the Prime Game.
- **Python Programming**: The code utilizes loops, conditional statements, and arrays to implement game logic and algorithms efficiently.

## Usage

To test the `isWinner` function:
- Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x main_0.py
```
- Run the provided test script:

```bash
./main_0.py
```

This will display the winner of the Prime Game for the given rounds and sets of consecutive integers.
